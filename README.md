This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The source code is hosted on GitHub and automatically deployed to an Amazon S3 bucket using GitHub Actions.
Whenever changes are made to the files in the workspace and pushed to the GitHub repository, the updates are automatically reflected in the S3 bucket.


To set up the project locally, clone the repository and open the HTML file in your browser.
For deployment, ensure your GitHub repository is linked to an S3 bucket and that the GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured to handle the deployment process. 
This allows for seamless updates and easy version control.
